# Configuration

Pepperminto uses environment variables in the root `.env` and per-app `.env` files. The API reads most runtime settings.

## Core API settings

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/pepperminto
JWT_SECRET=replace-me
```

## Optional settings

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG` – enable PostHog analytics in the client.
- SMTP settings can be configured from the admin UI under **Settings → SMTP**.
- OIDC settings can be configured from the admin UI under **Settings → Authentication**.

## Client settings

The admin dashboard reads API settings from the same origin during development. Requests are proxied through `next.config.js` to the API base.

## Knowledge Base

The public knowledge base reads articles through the API. Only articles marked as published are visible on the public site.
