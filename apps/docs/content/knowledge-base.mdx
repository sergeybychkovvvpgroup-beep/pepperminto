# Knowledge Base

Pepperminto includes a public knowledge base site and an admin-only editor.

## Public site

The public KB is served from `apps/knowledge-base` and is read-only. It only displays articles marked as published.

## Admin management

From the admin dashboard, open **Knowledge Base** in the sidebar to:

- Create and edit articles
- Set author and tags (CSV)
- Toggle published/unpublished
- Preview changes instantly

## Recommended structure

- Keep titles short and scannable.
- Use tags for quick filtering.
- Include clear steps and screenshots where possible.

## Slugs

Slugs must be unique and are used in the public URLs. Update slugs carefully; changing a slug updates the public link.
